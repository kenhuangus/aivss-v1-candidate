"""Annex B -- the withdrawn AIVSS v0.8/v0.9 agentic uplift model. INFORMATIVE ONLY.

Retained solely so organizations holding v0.8 scores can reproduce them and
migrate. Appendix E records the objection that this construction "risks
double-counting, treats ordinal factors as additive, and creates severity
inflation without recalibrating the full scoring model"; the AIVSS working group
accepts the second and third of those as valid and does not publish this model
as normative. It is scheduled for removal at v1.0.

Two things changed relative to v0.8:

* The mitigation factor applies to the uplift only, not to the whole sum. This
  repairs a real defect: under v0.8, MF=0.67 could return a score below the CVSS
  base, which is incoherent. The repaired form guarantees
  CVSS_Base <= AIVSS_S <= 10.0.
* The category weight table is withdrawn. Its values were asserted, never
  calibrated, and produced up to a 1.92x spread in the amplification term from
  the risk label alone. The factor mean is now unweighted.

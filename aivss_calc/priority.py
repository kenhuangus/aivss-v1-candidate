"""Optional, organization-local, uncalibrated priority experiment.

AIVSS-P is non-portable and must not be used as a standard risk score. Its
likelihood input must be an organization's documented residual likelihood for
the assessed deployment. Because that estimate can overlap CVSS Threat,
Agentic AI reliability, or exposure evidence, adopters must define and test a
local de-duplication policy before operational use.
